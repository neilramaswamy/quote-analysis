A narrow Fellow in the Grass
Occasionally rides -.
You may have met him? Did you not
His notice instant is -.

The Grass divides as with a Comb,
A spotted Shaft is seen,.
And then it closes at your Feet
And opens further on -.

He likes a Boggy Acre -  
A Floor too cool for Corn -.
But when a Boy and Barefoot
I more than once at Noon.

Have passed I thought a Whip Lash
Unbraiding in the Sun.
When stooping to secure it
It wrinkled And was gone -.

Several of Natureâ€™s People
I know, and they know me.
I feel for them a transport
Of Cordiality.

But never met this Fellow
Attended or alone.
Without a tighter Breathing
And Zero at the Bone.
